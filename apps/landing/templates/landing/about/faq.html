            {% comment %}<h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}Why do you offer the assessment for free, while others either charge for it, or ask for personal information?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}We strongly believe in two things: simplicity of a web-tool, without any strings or fuss, and the assessment, like any piece of information, should be easy and free.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}Do I have to pay anything to sign-up for the marketplace?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}No, it is completely free for you, we only charge installers.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}Can I only assess the potential of my roof, or could it be anything?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}This is one of the best parts of our web-tool, you are not limited to your roof-top any more. You can now look-up your car-park, swimming pool, common areas in a business park, farm or any other area, as long as it is out in the open.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}How can my business profit from a renewable energy project?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}Businesses are fairly high consumers of electricity and pay anywhere between 8p/unit and 14.5p/unit to buy electricity from the grid. By installing a renewable energy project for captive use, businesses can generate a part of their energy need in-house, reducing their electricity expense. In the UK, for every unit of electricity generated by a renewable source, the project owner also receives additional income - Feed-in-tariff (FiT), adding to those savings.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            <br/>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}How long does it take to break even with my investment?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}Break-even of a project can vary based on region, renewable energy source, government policy, the electricity tariff that your business pays to the utility and how you finance the project. Nevertheless, we would recommend you to conduct an initial assessment using our web-tool and to create an account. The account would give you the opportunity to customise your renewable energy project, tweak assumptions based on your business operations, find high-quality and cost-competitive suppliers and finance options that fit your business’ needs.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}Are there any special regulations I have to take care of?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}No, PowerMarket will care of that for you.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}What about maintenance?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}Maintenance of a project could change depending on technology. However, our team would work closely with you to ensure that you only buy a project that has all the right maintenance and project performance warranties.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}How do you calculate / capture solar data?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}PowerMarket does not collect its own data. Instead we are using data available from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).{% endblocktrans %}</p>
            <br/>

            {# Question. #}
            <h3>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ question' %}How accurate are savings+income figures?{% endblocktrans %}</h3>
            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}The savings+income assessment is based on a number of factors such as PowerMarket’s IP assessment algorithm, average cost of electricity tariff paid to the utility, FiT, export tariff, solar irradiation data etc. If interested, you can sign up for an account, add your custom data and get a more precise assessment.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

            <p>{% blocktrans context 'FAQ answer' %}Not yet, but these are exactly some of the things we are currently working on.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
