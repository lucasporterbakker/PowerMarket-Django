    <h3>Linking to our sites</h3>

    <p>You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement on our part where none exists.</p>
    <p>You must not establish a link from any website that is not owned by you.</p>
    <p>Our sites must not be framed on any other site, nor may you create a link to any part of our sites other than the home page. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice. The website from which you are linking must comply in all respects with our content standards.</p>

    <h3>Links from our sites</h3>

    <p>Where our sites contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only.  We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources, and accept no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.</p>

    <h3>Interactive services</h3>

    <p>We may from time to time provide interactive services on our sites, including, without limitation:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chat rooms.</li>
        <li>Bulletin boards.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(interactive services).</p>
    <p>Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).</p>
    <p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our sites, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our sites, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.</p>
    <p>The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</p>
    <p>Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>

    <h3>Suspension and termination</h3>

    <p>We will determine, in our discretion, whether there has been a breach of these terms through your use of our sites.  When a breach of these terms has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate.</p>

        <li>Disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We exclude liability for actions taken in response to breaches of these terms.  The responses described in these terms are not limited, and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.</p>
